            <h1 id="colorhead">Albert Einstein</h1>
            <p> 
                Albert Einstein(opens in new tab) is often cited as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.
                His work continues to help astronomers study everything from gravitational waves to Mercury's orbit. 
                The scientist's equation that helped explain special relativity  E = mc<sup>2</sup> is famous even among those who don't
                understand its underlying physics. Einstein is also known for his theory of general relativity (an explanation of gravity),
                and the photoelectric effect (which explains the behavior of electrons under certain circumstances); his work on the latter 
                earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.Einstein also tried in vain to unify all the forces of the universe in a single 
                theory, or a theory of everything, which he was still working on at the time of his death.

    <p> 
        One of the greatest theoretical physicists in history was considered to be Stephen Hawking. 
        His groundbreaking research on the Big Bang and the universe's structure, as well as his best-selling books,
        have attracted readers who may not share Hawking's scientific expertise. At the age of 76, Hawking passed away 
        on March 14, 2018.Despite never disclosing his IQ, Stephen Hawking was widely regarded as the brightest person alive.
        Hawking reportedly said, "I have no clue, people who boast about their IQ are losers," when a New York Times reporter 
        reportedly asked him what his IQ was. We examine Hawking's schooling and career in this brief biography.

        <p>
            Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production,
            transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed
            AC generation and transmission technology. Though he was famous and respected, he was never able to translate his copious
            inventions into long-term financial success‚Äîunlike his early employer and chief rival, Thomas Edison.

        about the law of gravity, but his ‚ÄúPrincipia Mathematica‚Äù (1686) with its three laws of motion greatly influenced the Enlightenment in Europe.
        Born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England, Sir Isaac Newton began developing his theories on light, calculus and celestial mechanics while on break 
        from Cambridge University.Years of research culminated with the 1687 publication of ‚ÄúPrincipia,‚Äù a landmark work that established the universal
        laws of motion and gravity.Newton's second major book, ‚ÄúOpticks,‚Äù detailed his experiments to determine the properties of light. Also a student 
        of Biblical history and alchemy,the famed scientist served as president of the Royal Society of London and master of England's Royal Mint until 
        his death in 1727.Isaac Newton: Early Life and Education.
